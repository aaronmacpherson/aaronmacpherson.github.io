            <h1>About me</h1>
            <p>
                So lets start off with a little bit of personal background. I was born and raised in Nova Scotia until
                2004 when we moved to Ontario. I've always had a passing interest in technology but never pursued it in
                education until recently. I spent most of my high school years and early college years studying in
                several business subjects like accounting, microeconomics, macroeconomics, project management,
                human resource, etc. It wasn't until my final year taking the general business program at Conestoga
                that I finally realized that my passions lied elsewhere. I started teaching myself some Java coding
                during that time and my interest in technology grew to be something much more. After graduating from
                business I applied to the Computer Programmer/Analyst program at Conestoga College and now here I am!
            </p>
            <p>
                When I'm not working on school projects I like to play video games, read, watch movies, play with our
                cat Houdini, and swim (during the 2 months that Canada gets some sun).
